the streaming static site generator

# naming

Stratic stands for STReaming stATIC site generator.

I also considered Glug, which stands for GulpLog Universal Generator. GulpLog is supposed to sound similar to weblog and Glug is supposed to sound similar to Gulp. In the end, though, Stratic won out.
